	abstract = {Insurance coverage through the traditional Medicare program is complex, fragmented,
and incomplete. Beneficiaries must purchase supplemental private insurance to fill
in the gaps. While impoverished beneficiaries may receive supplemental coverage through
Medicaid and subsidies for prescription drugs, help is limited for people with incomes above
the poverty level. This patchwork quilt leads to confusion for beneficiaries and high administrative
costs, while also undermining coverage and care coordination. Most important, Medicare‚Äôs
benefits fail to limit out-of-pocket costs or ensure adequate financial protection, especially for
beneficiaries with low incomes and serious health problems. This brief, part of a series about
Medicare‚Äôs past, present, and future, presents options for an integrated benefit for enrollees in
traditional Medicare. The new benefit would not only reduce cost burdens but also could potentially
strengthen the Medicare program and enhance its role in stimulating and supporting innovations
throughout the health care delivery system.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
Objectives: To assess the generosity of drug coverage in federally facilitated Health Insurance Exchanges (HIEs).
Study Design: We linked publicly available benefit design data from 36 federally facilitated HIEs with drug formulary data for 10 therapeutic categories from Managed Markets Insight \& Technology. We used health plans as our unit of analysis.
Methods: We created a generosity index reflecting the ratio of patients‚Äô out-of-pocket payments to the total drug price (higher values indicate less generous coverage). Because patients‚Äô total out-of-pocket spending changes throughout the year due to deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, we also examined generosity by varying levels of annual drug spending.
Results: Platinum plans covered nearly 90\% of drugs that we studied, while bronze, silver, and gold plans covered approximately 80\%; results by therapeutic category were similar. Nine in 10 plans used 4- to 6-tier drug formularies, and approximately 24\% of branded drugs were associated with some type of utilization management. Bronze plans were less generous than other metal levels, requiring consumers to pay about 94\% of the total pharmaceutical costs prior to the deductible being met, while platinum plans required consumers to pay about 43\% of such costs. As consumers‚Äô out-of-pocket spending increased throughout the year, differences in generosity across plans narrowed. 
Conclusions: Benefit structure and formulary design contribute to significant variation in prescription drug coverage generosity within HIEs. These characteristics of health plans are important for individuals with high out-of-pocket costs.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine whether physician preferences for end-of-life care were associated with variation in health care spending. Method: We studied 737 physicians who completed the life-sustaining treatment questionnaire in 1999 and were linked to end-of-life care data for the years 1999 to 2009 from Medicare-eligible beneficiaries from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care (in hospital-related regions [HRRs]). Using latent class analysis to group physician preferences for end-of-life treatment into most, intermediate, and least aggressive categories, we examined how physician preferences were associated with health care spending over a 7-year period. Results: When all HRRs in the nation were arrayed in quartiles by spending, the prevalence of study physicians who preferred aggressive end-of-life care was greater in the highest spending HRRs. The mean area-level intensive care unit charges per patient were estimated to be US\$1,595 higher in the last 6 months of life and US\$657 higher during the hospitalization in which death occurred for physicians who preferred the most aggressive treatment at the end of life, when compared with average spending. Conclusions: Physician preference for aggressive end-of-life care was correlated with area-level spending in the last 6 months of life. Policy measures intended to minimize geographic variation in health care spending should incorporate physician preferences and style.},

Design Retrospective cohort analysis of IMS Health LRx LifeLink database. Setting U.S. retail pharmacy transactions. Participants Incident statin users who initiated branded atorvastatin or rosuvastatin between June 2006 and February 2013. Main Outcomes and Measures Monthly statin utilization (pill-days of therapy), switching (filling a different statin), termination (failure to refill statin for 6 mo), and out-of-pocket and total costs. Results Of 1.1 million incident atorvastatin and rosuvastatin users, 2\% used a coupon for at least one statin fill. At 1 year, compared with noncoupon users, those who used a statin coupon on their first fill were dispensed an equal number of monthly pill-days (23.7 vs 23.8), were less likely to switch statins (14.4\% vs 16.3\%), and were less likely to have terminated statin therapy (31.3\% vs 39.2\%). At 4 years, coupon users were more likely to have switched (45.5\% vs 40.8\%) and less likely to have terminated statin therapy (50.6\% vs 61.1\%) compared with noncoupon users. Those who used greater numbers of coupons were substantially less likely to switch and terminate statin therapies. Monthly out-of-pocket costs were lower among coupon than noncoupon users at 1 year (\$9.7 vs \$15.1), but total monthly costs were qualitatively similar (\$115.5 vs \$116.9). At 4 years, monthly out-of-pocket costs among coupon users remained lower (\$14.3 vs \$16.6) compared with noncoupon users. Sensitivity analyses supported the main results. Conclusions Coupons for branded statins are associated with higher utilization and lower rates of discontinuation and short-term switching to other statin products.},

Our primary objective was to examine the variability in drug coverage in the exchanges across plan types (health maintenance organization or preferred provider organization) and metal tiers (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum). Our secondary objective was to compare the exchange coverage to employer-sponsored coverage. Analyzing prescription drug benefit design data for the federally facilitated exchanges, we found wide variation in enrollees‚Äô out-of-pocket costs for generic, preferred brand-name, nonpreferred brand-name, and specialty drugs, not only across metal tiers but also within those tiers across plan types. Compared to employer-sponsored plans, exchange plans generally had lower premiums but provided less generous drug coverage. However, for low-income enrollees who are eligible for cost-sharing subsidies, the exchange plans may be more comparable to employer-based coverage. Policies and programs to assist consumers in matching their prescription drug needs with a plan‚Äôs benefit design may improve the financial protection for the newly insured.},

	abstract = {Context Medicare's reimbursement policy was changed in 1998 to provide coverage for screening colonoscopies for patients with increased colon cancer risk, and expanded further in 2001 to cover screening colonoscopies for all individuals. Objective To determine whether the Medicare reimbursement policy changes were associated with an increase in either colonoscopy use or early stage colon cancer diagnosis. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare linked database who were 67 years of age and older and had a primary diagnosis of colon cancer during 1992-2002, as well as a group of Medicare beneficiaries who resided in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results areas but who were not diagnosed with cancer. Main Outcome Measures Trends in colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy use among Medicare beneficiaries without cancer were assessed using multivariate Poisson regression. Among the patients with cancer, stage was classified as early (stage I) vs all other (stages II-IV). Time was categorized as period 1 (no screening coverage, 1992-1997), period 2 (limited coverage, January 1998-June 2001), and period 3 (universal coverage, July 2001-December 2002). A multivariate logistic regression (outcome = early stage) was used to assess temporal trends in stage at diagnosis; an interaction term between tumor site and time was included. Results Colonoscopy use increased from an average rate of 285/100 000 per quarter in period 1 to 889 and 1919/100 000 per quarter in periods 2 (P{\textless}.001) and 3 (P vs 2{\textless}.001), respectively. During the study period, 44 924 eligible patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The proportion of patients diagnosed at an early stage increased from 22.5\% in period 1 to 25.5\% in period 2 and 26.3\% in period 3 (P{\textless}.001 for each pairwise comparison). The changes in Medicare coverage were strongly associated with early stage at diagnosis for patients with proximal colon lesions (adjusted relative risk period 2 vs 1, 1.19; 95\% confidence interval, 1.13-1.26; adjusted relative risk period 3 vs 2, 1.10; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.17) but weakly associated, if at all, for patients with distal colon lesions (adjusted relative risk period 2 vs 1, 1.07; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.13; adjusted relative risk period 3 vs 2, 0.97; 95\% confidence interval, 0.90-1.05). Conclusions Expansion of Medicare reimbursement to cover colon cancer screening was associated with an increased use of colonoscopy for Medicare beneficiaries, and for those who were diagnosed with colon cancer, an increased probability of being diagnosed at an early stage. The selective effect of the coverage change on proximal colon lesions suggests that increased use of whole-colon screening modalities such as colonoscopy may have played a pivotal role.},

Using a nationwide longitudinal sample of U.S. veterans with and without PTSD (N = 1,377) enrolled in VHA health care, we determined the costs and utilization of mental health and non‚Äìmental health outpatient, pharmacy, and inpatient services for 1 year following cohort enrollment.

I find that the expected share of spending subject to utilization management increases the observed share, with the smallest effect for prior authorization. Increases in the expected share of drug spending subject to prior authorization increases Part D spending by \$122.27 per percentage point, with almost three-quarters of this increase being paid by the Medicare program, rather than beneficiaries or plans. Comparable increases in step therapy and quantity limit exposure increase spending by \$46 and decrease spending by \$31, respectively. Interestingly, increased exposure to prior authorization and quantity limits increases the average price per 30-day prescription.},

I find that the expansions increased insurance coverage by between 22 and 30 percentage points, in models that include trends in age, with the increase explained by Medicare coverage, and increased physician visits by 25‚Äì35 percent. These expansions also decreased mortality due to kidney disease in the under 65 population by between 0.5 and 1.0 deaths per 100,000. Lastly, I provide evidence for two mechanisms that affected mortality: an increase in access to and use of treatment, which may be due to changes in insurance coverage; and an increase in entry of dialysis clinics and transplant programs.},

Yet in 2014 an estimated 40 percent of low-income beneficiaries spent 20 percent or more of their incomes on out-of-pocket expenditures for premiums and medical care, while one-third were underinsured based on their out-of-pocket spending for medical care alone. These high burdens reflect Medicare‚Äôs limited benefits and restrictive income eligibility levels for supplemental Medicaid coverage. We examined the impacts of illustrative policies designed to improve beneficiaries‚Äô financial protection and access to care by reducing Medicare premiums and cost sharing for covered benefits on a sliding scale for all beneficiaries with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. We estimate that these policies could improve the affordability of health care for eleven million people. Designed to be aligned with the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs subsidy approach for the population younger than age sixty-five, these policies also have the potential to smooth transitions into Medicare, reduce administrative costs, and provide a more secure and equitable foundation for Medicare‚Äôs future.},

This paper provides important, new evidence on the characteristics of NIH SBIR projects that fail.

We also find, after controlling for the endogenous nature of woman-owned firms, that such firms are also less likely to fail.},

The EHB regulates the number of drugs covered but leaves other dimensions (cost sharing and utilization management) of the formulary unregulated. Using data on almost all formularies in the country, I demonstrate that requiring insurers to cover one additional drug adds 0.22 drugs (3.3\%) to the average formulary, mostly owing to firms increasing the number of drugs covered to comply with the EHB requirement. The EHB requirement also increases the probability that a drug is subject to utilization management and is assigned to a higher (more costly) formulary tier. My results suggest that newly covered drugs are 22.3 percentage points more likely to be subject to utilization management, compared to 36.7\% for the average covered drug. Using formularies for Medicare Advantage plans, which are subject to uniform, nationwide benefit design standards, and the formulary status of newly approved drugs that do not satisfy the EHB requirement, I reject the hypotheses that consumer demand or effects on plan entry can explain my results.

The authors identified 7 stage-specific processes of cancer therapy by using Medicare claims. Candidate covariates in multivariate logistic regression included year, clinical, and sociodemographic characteristics, and physician access before cancer diagnosis.During the full study period, black patients were significantly less likely than white patients to receive therapy for cancers of the lung (surgical resection of early stage, 64.0\% vs 78.5\% for blacks and whites, respectively), breast (radiation after lumpectomy, 77.8\% vs 85.8\%), colon (adjuvant therapy for stage III, 52.1\% vs 64.1\%), and prostate (definitive therapy for early stage, 72.4\% vs 77.2\%, respectively). For both black and white patients, there was little or no improvement in the proportion of patients receiving therapy for most cancer therapies studied, and there was no decrease in the magnitude of any of these racial disparities between 1992 and 2002. Racial disparities persisted even after restricting the analysis to patients who had physician access before their diagnosis.There has been little improvement in either the overall proportion of Medicare beneficiaries receiving cancer therapies or the magnitude of racial disparity.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Deaths from prescription opioids have reached epidemic levels in the United States, yet little is known about how insurers' coverage policies may affect rates of fatal and nonfatal overdose among individuals filling an opioid prescription.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using 2010-2016 Medicare claims data for beneficiaries with 1 or more filled prescriptions for a Schedule II opioid.
METHODS: Outcomes were opioid volume dispensed in morphine milligram equivalents (MME), number of days supplied, and number of pills dispensed on each prescription and emergency department or inpatient stay associated with an opioid overdose during a prescription or within 7 days of the end of the prescription.
RESULTS: A total of 7.03 million prescriptions for Schedule II opioids were dispensed over 1.87 million Part D beneficiary-years. The 7.03 million opioid prescriptions were associated with 8.5 opioid overdoses per 10,000 prescriptions. Prior authorization was associated with larger opioid volumes per prescription (103.6 MME; 95\% CI, 36.2-171.0). Step therapy was associated with a greater number of days supplied (0.62 days; 95\% CI, 0.10-1.13) and more pills dispensed (6.12 pills; 95\% CI, 2.17-10.1). Quantity limits were associated with smaller opioid volumes (24.3 MME; 95\% CI, 12.3-36.3) and fewer pills dispensed (2.35 pills; 95\% CI, 1.77-2.93). In adjusted models, beneficiaries filling an opioid requiring prior authorization experienced 3.3 fewer overdoses per 10,000 prescriptions (95\% CI, 0.41-6.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Opioid utilization management among these beneficiaries was associated with mixed effects on opioid prescribing, and prior authorization was associated with a decreased likelihood of subsequent overdose. Further work exploring the impact of utilization management and insurer policies is needed.},

	abstract = {School and college reopening-closure policies are considered one of the most promising non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating infectious diseases. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these policies is still debated, largely due to the lack of empirical evidence on behavior during implementation. We examined U.S. college reopenings‚Äô association with changes in human mobility within campuses and in COVID-19 incidence in the counties of the campuses over a twenty-week period around college reopenings in the Fall of 2020. We used an integrative framework, with a difference-in-differences design comparing areas with a college campus, before and after reopening, to areas without a campus and a Bayesian approach to estimate the daily reproductive number (Rt). We found that college reopenings were associated with increased campus mobility, and increased COVID-19 incidence by 4.9 cases per 100,000 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9‚Äì6.9), or a 37\% increase relative to the pre-period mean. This reflected our estimate of increased transmission locally after reopening. A greater increase in county COVID-19 incidence resulted from campuses that drew students from counties with high COVID-19 incidence in the weeks before reopening (œá2(2) = 8.9, p = 0.012) and those with a greater share of college students, relative to population (œá2(2) = 98.83, p {\textless} 0.001). Even by Fall of 2022, large shares of populations remained unvaccinated, increasing the relevance of understanding non-pharmaceutical decisions over an extended period of a pandemic. Our study sheds light on movement and social mixing patterns during the closure-reopening of colleges during a public health threat, and offers strategic instruments for benefit-cost analyses of school reopening/closure policies.},

Echoing a theme from the literature on the 2020 closures, mobility outside the home increased on average prior to these state actions.
