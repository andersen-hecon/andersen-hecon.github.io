I have taught a variety of courses during my time at UNCG. Currently I regularly teach ECO 637, Empirical Health Economics, ECO 498, Capstone Seminar in Economics, and ECO 201, Principles of Microeconomics. I have previously taught Health Economics at both the undergraduate and doctoral level and microeconomic theory at the master's level.

## Using AI in teaching

I have become a big fan of using large language models to support my teaching. Currently, I have several ChatGPT bots that I have setup with course materials, or the closest I could get that I could feed into the chatbot, so that I can use the bot to help me with material development.
