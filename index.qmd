I am **Martin Sparre Andersen**, an Associate Professor in the [Department of Economics](economics.uncg.edu) at the Bryan School of Business and Economics at the [University of North Carolina at Greensboro](uncg.edu). I hold a BA in Mathematics from Columbia University, an MPH in Health Policy from Yale University, and a PhD in Health Policy with a concentration in Economics from Harvard University. After completing my doctoral studies, I pursued a one-year postdoctoral fellowship at the National Bureau for Economic Research.

My primary research interests lie in the fields of health and education economics, with a particular focus on utilizing human mobility data. To date, I have been involved in projects on cancer care, health insurance, prescription drug benefit design, and reproductive health care. I am also active in, essentially, epidemiological research, trying to infer disease trends from mobility data.
